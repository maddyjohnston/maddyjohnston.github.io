Due to the separation in our everyday experience of the river people have less respect for the tributary and treat the space as a dumping ground for unwanted items. The pictured objects are all man-made objects that displayed decay due to the forces of the Frome. The power of the river on the discarded objects is shown through the eroded topography of each artefact portrayed through the contours extracted from the digital models of the artefacts created with photogrammetry.",

The objective of the mapping is to portray site information that would not otherwise be included in conventional architectural drawings. The contours of my found objects are scaled up and curated to represent the decaying interaction between people and the river. The temporality of decay as an action is encapsulated in the snapshot of the objects as they were when discovered on site.",

The M32 was more of a divide than the River Frome and therefore we made the motorway the axis of the installation. To emphasise the motorways effect on the area we manipulated the mapping to make the motorway straight - represented with the steel channel.",

These walls are made of cast in-situ concrete sandwiched around insulation, the formwork will be timber planks to create horizontal lines in the finish surface. To Contrast the ground floor construction the steel pratt truss structure will be left visible coated with intumescent paint to ensure fire resistance.",

Therefore a key component to the riverside design was the buildings capability for dealing with flood waters. To reduce the risk of flooding on the site and weaken the flow of the river, gabion walls will be introduced along the river edge. Whilst permeable paving will allow surface water runoff and flood water to penetrate to the earth underneath.",

    $('#description').html(`This project focuses around Bristol waterways as a connecting body rather than dividing lines, through the understanding of archipelagos. The body of water that connects this project to the city of Bristol is the River Frome, a tributary to the River Avon which has been subject to many man-made interventions culverting the route of the river and passing it through tunnels underneath the city centre to suit our needs as the industry of the city has developed. The project follows an alternative route through site analysis to designing the building, with a focus on sociological connections within urban fragmentations along the River Frome. Site Analysis is first recorded through a mapping created as a group of four students and then translated into a group instlalation, from which my proposal developed.`);
