                        Our project for second semester was based on re[de]fined vernacular. Our site was the eastern side of Sutton Harbour in Plymouth City centre, 
                        however the semester began with a study trip to Copenhagen, Denmark. Our site has elements of historic eras / activity which has been neglected 
                        over the years to make way for industrial units and sea-view apartment blocks with little public realm or sense of community. Our masterplan was 
                        developed based on the fundamental idea of celebrating the hidden heritage of East Sutton Harbour, with amenities that create employment opportunities 
                        whilst activating the public realm.

                            During our study trip we analysed the public realm of the city, along with diagramming buildings that have interesting relationship to 
                            public realm or the notion of interior and exterior such as; the Danish National Bank, The Royal Danish Playhouse, and Louisianaâ€™s Museum of Modern Art.

                            Our analysis began with experiencing the site at different times of day. We surveyed multiple passerbys and residents about their knowledge of the 
                            local area. From this, as a group we could compile the strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and constraints onto this large map. 
                            By converting the local knowledge into a visual format, we could demonstrate lack of heritage on the eastern side of Sutton Harbour 
                            (our site) and its celebration on the western side (the Barbican). This had a large influence on the development of the masterplan theme.

                            Knowledge gathering and ananlysis along with additional analysis carried out were translated into presentation sheets such as the one above. 
                            To analyse the public realm of the site deeper we compared this to precedents from our study trip to Copenhagen and other areas in plymouth.

                            Our masterplan developed further through connections that were made between the individual proposals and the wider city. 
                            The journey through our masterplan involved a boat trip to explore various sites of historic interest around plymouth. This 
                            connected us to the sense of arrival and departure that once placed Plymouth at the heart of the industrial import and export trade. 
                            Other proposals on the site look at reinstating the forgotten trades that used to be on the site through creating public/educational 
                            facilities that incorporate trades such as clay, and fishing.

                            My proposal looked at giving the timber trade more presence on site by re-creating the old boat building workshops and teaching traditional boat building 
                            to local residents and the public. I began by analysing the processes that occur within a workshop to help re-establish their place in the harbour site. 
                            These processes fell into three categories as described by the diagrams above; Relation to Heritage, Process of Timber, Development of People.

                            The timber yard within our masterplan has an interesting relationship with an aged stone wall. I used the existing spaces on the site and experimented 
                            with massing and places that were crucial to creating the processes and dynamics that had presented themselves through the process diagrams.

                            To show the connection of my proposal to the masterplan and the harbour, this hand-drawn skeletal isometric drawing was a key drawing of my project. 
                            This drawing shows how the workshops face the public realm and the journey the raw timber material takes as it makes its way to the water.

                            To show the layering effect each of the spaces within the proposal has, each space displays a new stage of the processes. An important aspect was the 
                            relationship of the public to the workshops. Public have the ability to travel through the workshops on a higher level where they can observe and experience 
                            the workflow of each process without being in any danger of the work harzards below. To situate the section drawings the stone wall holds the centre of each drawing, showing the 
                            relationship to the workspaces, the historic wall is the backbone of the new activity.
